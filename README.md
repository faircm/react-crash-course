# React Job Board

This is a simple little app I used to improve my knowledge of TypeScript, React and Express. It builds off of Traversy Media's [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDB4uaJ87e0), but uses TypeScript for my own benefit.

As a personal touch, I created a SQLite database to store the job data, and an Node + Express backend to handle database manipulation.

# Running on your machine

- After pulling the code, run ```npm i``` in both the root and server folders.
- Open two terminals, one in the root folder and one in the server folder.
- In the root terminal, execute ```npm run dev``` to start the front end.
- In the server terminal, execute ```npm start``` to start the back end and connect to the DB.
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the web app.

Thanks for checking out my project!
